### Scenario 1

- Comparison of total sales from the fiscal quarters of 2008 to the fiscal quarters of 2007
- Fiscal year is from June to July

**Test Example**

```{sql}
SELECT
a.SalesPersonID,
c.LastName,
/*add 6 months to orderdate to get fiscal year from July to June*/
YEAR(DATEADD(MONTH,6,a.OrderDate)) as FY, /*result is a year*/
DATEPART(QUARTER,DATEADD(MONTH,6,a.OrderDate)) as FQ, /*result is a number of quarter*/
SUM(a.SubTotal) as FQSales,  /*sum of sales*/
SUM(b.SubTotal) as SameSalesFQLast,  /*sum of sales*/
SUM(a.SubTotal)-SUM(b.SubTotal) as Change,  /*difference between sum of sales*/
((SUM(a.SubTotal)-SUM(b.SubTotal)) /SUM(b.SubTotal)) * 100 as pct_change  /*percentage*/
/*2018-2017/2017*/
 /*join two same tables to itself and specify dates in tables*/
  
FROM [Sales].[SalesOrderHeader] a left join [Sales].[SalesOrderHeader] b
ON a.SalesPersonID=b.SalesPersonID
/*quarters in both tables are same*/
AND DATEPART(QUARTER,DATEADD(MONTH,6,b.OrderDate))=DATEPART(QUARTER,DATEADD(MONTH,6,a.OrderDate))
/*table b is in 2008 and table a is in 2007*/
AND DATEPART(YEAR,DATEADD(MONTH,6,b.OrderDate))=DATEPART(YEAR,DATEADD(MONTH,6,a.OrderDate))-1
INNER JOIN Person.[Person] c 
ON c.BusinessEntityID=a.SalesPersonID
WHERE DATEPART(YEAR,DATEADD(MONTH,6,a.OrderDate))=2008
GROUP BY 1,2,3,4
```

**Real Example**

```{sql}
SELECT
DATEPART(YEAR,DATEADD(MONTH,6,a.impression_dt)) as FY, /*result is a year*/
DATEPART(QUARTER,DATEADD(MONTH,6,a.impression_dt)) as FQ, /*result is a number of quarter*/
COUNT(a.sudid) as FQSales,  /*sum of sales*/
COUNT(b.sudid) as SameSalesFQLast,  /*sum of sales*/
COUNT(a.sudid)-COUNT(b.sudid) as Change,  /*difference between sum of sales*/
((COUNT(a.sudid)-COUNT(b.sudid))/COUNT(b.sudid))*100 as pct_change  /*percentage*/

FROM fact_impressions a left join fact_impressions b
  ON a.sudid = b.sudid
  AND DATEPART(QUARTER,DATEADD(MONTH,6,b.impression_dt))=DATEPART(QUARTER,DATEADD(MONTH,6,a.impression_dt))
  AND DATEPART(YEAR,DATEADD(MONTH,6,b.impression_dt))=DATEPART(YEAR,DATEADD(MONTH,6,a.impression_dt))-1
WHERE DATEPART(YEAR,DATEADD(MONTH,6,a.impression_dt))=2018
  AND DATEPART(QUARTER, DATEADD(MONTH,6,a.impression_dt)) = 4
GROUP BY 1,2
```

### Scenario 2

2/22 promotion, orders subtotaling at least $\$2,000$ ship for $\$0.22$. The strategy assumes that freight losses will be offset by gains from higher value orders. Orders between $1,700 and $\$2,000$ will likely boost to $\$2,000$ as customers feel compelled to take advantage of bargain freight pricing

- Potential Promotional Effect
- Potential order gains
- Potential freight losses
- Overall net gain/loss

**Test Example**

```{sql}
SELECT 
  a.SalesOrderID, --Order ID
  a.OrderDate, -- Date
  d.Name AS Ship_to_State, -- State
  a.SubTotal AS Historical_Order_Total, -- Prior to discount
  a.Freight AS Historical_Freight, -- Prior to discount
  CASE 
    WHEN a.SubTotal>=1700 and a.SubTotal<2000 THEN 'Increase order to 2000 and pay 22 cents as Freight'
    WHEN a.SubTotal>=2000 THEN 'No Order Change but pay 22 cents as Freight' 
    ELSE 'No order change and pay historical freight' 
    END as Promo_Effect,
  CASE
    WHEN a.SubTotal>=1700 and a.SubTotal<2000 THEN 2000 - a.SubTotal 
    ELSE 0 
    END as Potential_Order_Gain,
  CASE 
    WHEN a.SubTotal>=1700 THEN 0.22 else a.Freight END  - a.Freight as PotentialFreightoss,
  (CASE 
    WHEN a.SubTotal>=1700 and a.SubTotal<2000 then 2000 -a.SubTotal 
    ELSE 0 
    END + 
      CASE 
        WHEN a.SubTotal>=1700 THEN 0.22 ELSE a.Freight 
        END )- 
          a.Freight AS PromoNetGain_Loss
FROM [Sales].[SalesOrderHeader] a
  JOIN Person.BusinessEntityAddress b ON a.ShipToAddressID=b.AddressID
  JOIN Person.[Address] c ON b.AddressID = c.AddressID
  JOIN Person.StateProvince d ON c.StateProvinceID=d.StateProvinceID
WHERE d.Name = 'California' 
  AND DATEPART (YEAR, DATEADD (MONTH, 6,a.OrderDate)) = 2008
```


### Scenario 12

You are asked to provide frequent updates about the product inventory.


**Test Example**

```{sql}
-- final table includes quantity of each product and total of all products
SELECT
  b.name,
  count(distinct a.ProductID) AS ProductCount,
  sum(a.Quantity) as ProductQty
FROM [Production].[ProductInventory] a
JOIN [Production].[Location] b ON a.LocationID=b.LocationID
GROUP BY (b.name)

UNION

SELECT 
  'Total' ,
  count(distinct a.ProductID) AS ProductCount,
  SUM(a.Quantity) as ProductQty
FROM [Production].[ProductInventory] a
```

### Scenario 13

Identify the employee or group of employees with the greatest number of vacation hours. Since many HR files are indexed by National ID Number, include the last four digits with your output.

**Test Example**

```{sql}
WITH MaxVacHrs AS 
	(SELECT MaxVacHrs = MAX (VacationHours) FROM HumanResources.Employee)
	
SELECT 
	RIGHT (N1.NationalIDNumber, 4) AS NationalID,
	N2.FirstName,
	N2.LastName,
	N1.JobTitle,
	N1.VacationHours
FROM HumanResources.Employee N1
  INNER JOIN Person.Person N2 ON N1.BusinessEntityID = N2.BusinessEntityID
  INNER JOIN MaxVacHrs N3 ON N1.VacationHours = N3.MaxVacHrs
```

### Scenario 14

For each product ordered by the Purchasing Department in 2007, indicate the quantity ordered by order date.

```{sql}
SELECT 
  b.ProductID,
  c.Name,
  a.OrderDate,
  sum(b.OrderQty) as QTY
FROM [Purchasing].[PurchaseOrderHeader] a 
  JOIN [Purchasing].[PurchaseOrderDetail] b ON a.PurchaseOrderID=b.PurchaseOrderID 
  JOIN [Production].[Product] c ON b.ProductID=c.ProductID
WHERE DATEPART(YEAR, a.OrderDate)=2007
GROUP BY  1,2,3
ORDER BY sum(b.OrderQty) DESC
```

### Scenario 15

List of all product descriptions written in languages other than English.

```{sql}
SELECT
  a.ProductModelID,
  a.Name,
  c.Description,
  b.CultureID
FROM [Production].[ProductModel] a
  JOIN [Production].[ProductModelProductDescriptionCulture] b ON a.ProductModelID=b.ProductModelID 
  JOIN  [Production].[ProductDescription] c ON b.ProductDescriptionID=c.ProductDescriptionID
WHERE b.CultureID != 'en'
```

### Scenario 20

Provide address data about stores with main offices located in Toronto.

```{sql}
SELECT 
  d.Name AS StoreName,
  a.AddressLine1,
  a.AddressLine2,
  a.City,c.Name,
  a.PostalCode
FROM [Person].[Address] a JOIN [Person].[BusinessEntityAddress] b ON a.AddressID=b.AddressID 
  JOIN [Person].[StateProvince] c  ON a.StateProvinceID=c.StateProvinceID
  JOIN [Sales].[Store] d ON d.BusinessEntityID=b.BusinessEntityID
WHERE b.AddressTypeID=3 -- or d.name = 'Main Office'
  AND a.City='Toronto'
```

### Scenario 21

List of employees who are currently in the Marketing department and were hired prior to 2002 or later than 2004.

```{sql}
SELECT
  d.FirstName,
  d.LastName,
  c.JobTitle,
  c.BirthDate,
  c.MaritalStatus,
  a.StartDate AS Hire_Date
FROM [HumanResources].[EmployeeDepartmentHistory] a 
  JOIN [HumanResources].[Department] b ON a.DepartmentID=b.DepartmentID
  JOIN [HumanResources].[Employee] c ON c.BusinessEntityID=a.BusinessEntityID
  JOIN  [Person].[Person] d ON d.BusinessEntityID=a.BusinessEntityID
WHERE 
  (DATEPART(YEAR, a.StartDate)<2002 
    OR DATEPART(YEAR, a.StartDate)>2004) 
  AND b.Name='Marketing' 
  AND a.EndDate IS NULL
```

### Scenario 22

Who left that review?

```{sql}
SELECT
  a.ProductReviewID,
  a.ProductID,
  b.Name,
  a.ReviewerName,
  a.Rating,
  a.EmailAddress,
  c.BusinessEntityID -- will be returned as 0
FROM [Production].[ProductReview] a 
JOIN [Production].[Product] b ON a.ProductID=b.ProductID
LEFT JOIN [Person].[EmailAddress] c ON a.EmailAddress=c.EmailAddress
```

### Scenario 23

List of customers with phone numbers for all orders for shorts placed online after July 7, 2008.

```{sql}
SELECT
  a.SalesOrderID,
  a.OrderDate,
  c.Name,
  f.FirstName,
  f.LastName,
  g.PhoneNumber
FROM [Sales].[SalesOrderHeader] a 
  INNER JOIN [Sales].[SalesOrderDetail] b ON a.SalesOrderID=b.SalesOrderID
  INNER JOIN [Production].[Product] c ON b.ProductID=c.ProductID
  INNER JOIN [Sales].[Customer] e ON e.CustomerID=a.CustomerID
  INNER JOIN [Person].[Person] f ON e.PersonID=f.BusinessEntityID
  INNER JOIN [Person].[PersonPhone] g ON g.BusinessEntityID=f.BusinessEntityID
WHERE a.OrderDate>'2008-07-07' 
 AND a.OnlineOrderFlag=1 
 AND LOWER(c.Name) LIKE '%shorts%'
ORDER BY a.SalesOrderID
```
